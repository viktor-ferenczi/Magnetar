# Magnetar PluginSdk — Configuration Handbook

`PluginSdk` is the small .NET Standard 2.0 library a Magnetar plugin uses to
declare its configuration. The same declaration drives three things at once:

1. **Local XML config** — sparse, on-disk, only non-default values.
2. **Remote JSON envelope** — schema + defaults + current values, consumed by
   the Quasar control plane.
3. **Web UI layout** — Quasar renders the editor from the schema; the plugin
   never ships any UI code.

You only write a `PluginConfig`-derived class with attribute-decorated
properties. Everything else (validation hints, UI tree, change notifications,
storage) is derived from those attributes by reflection.

## When to read what

| Document | When you need it |
|---|---|
| [Config.md](Config.md) | Writing the config class itself — base class contract, property pattern, change notification. |
| [Options.md](Options.md) | Picking the right attribute for a value (bool, ranges, strings, lists, dicts, structs). |
| [Layout.md](Layout.md) | Grouping options into tabs, sections and columns for the Web UI. |
| [Mutation.md](Mutation.md) | **Must read.** The in-place mutation pitfall that silently breaks remote sync. |
| [Storage.md](Storage.md) | Loading and saving — XML on disk, JSON over the wire. |
| [Example.md](Example.md) | Complete annotated config class to copy-paste from. |

## Minimal example

```csharp
using PluginSdk.Config;

public class MyPluginConfig : PluginConfig
{
    private bool enabled = true;
    private int tickRate = 60;

    [BoolOption("Enable the feature")]
    public bool Enabled { get => enabled; set => SetField(ref enabled, value); }

    [IntOption(1, 240, "Ticks per second")]
    public int TickRate { get => tickRate; set => SetField(ref tickRate, value); }
}
```

That is enough for Quasar to render a usable editor with a checkbox and a
bounded integer field, and for `ConfigStorage` to round-trip the values.

## What PluginSdk does *not* do

- It does not load, save, or watch files on its own — the plugin host calls
  `ConfigStorage.SaveXml` / `LoadXml` at appropriate moments.
- It does not push changes to Quasar — the host transports the JSON envelope.
- It does not render UI. The schema is metadata; the UI lives elsewhere.
- It does not expose a fluent builder or runtime registration API.
  Configuration is declared statically with attributes; reflection at
  `ConfigSchema.Build(typeof(MyPluginConfig))` produces the schema.
