# Configuration

There are **three** distinct folders involved, each overridable on the command
line:

| Folder | Holds | Default | Override |
| ------ | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| **Magnetar config dir** | Magnetar's own config, logs, preloader cache | Windows: `%APPDATA%\Magnetar`<br>Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Magnetar` → `~/.config/Magnetar` | `-config <dir>` |
| **DS install dir** | The dedicated-server binaries (`DedicatedServer64/`) | Auto-detected (see below) | `-ds64 <dir>` |
| **DS data dir (AppData)** | `SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg` **and the world saves** (`Saves/`) | Windows: `%APPDATA%\SpaceEngineersDedicated`<br>(`%APPDATA%` = roaming AppData) | `-path <dir>` |

## Command-line parameters that change folders

### `-config <dir>` — Magnetar's own config/log directory

Overrides where Magnetar stores its own configuration, logs, and the preloader
cache. A relative path resolves against the launcher's directory. This does
**not** affect the dedicated server's config or saves.

* **Install dir (default, where the launcher lives)**
  * Windows — `%APPDATA%\Magnetar`.
  * Linux — `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Magnetar`, falling back to `~/.local/share/Magnetar`.

### `-ds64 <dir>` — dedicated-server install location

Points Magnetar at the `DedicatedServer64/` folder containing
`SpaceEngineersDedicated.exe`. A relative path resolves against the launcher's
directory.

When not given, the DS install is auto-detected from the Steam registry
(Windows) or `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SpaceEngineersDedicatedServer/DedicatedServer64`
(Linux), or any Steam library listed in `libraryfolders.vdf`.

### `-path <dir>` — DS data directory (AppData: config + world saves)

This is the **dedicated server's own** argument; Magnetar passes the full
command line through to it. It sets the server *instance/data* directory — the
folder holding `SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg` and the `Saves/` worlds. Without
it, the server uses its default instance, `%APPDATA%\SpaceEngineersDedicated` on
Windows.

```sh
MagnetarInterim -path "D:\SE\MyServerInstance"
```

The directory **must already exist**. If it does not, Magnetar logs an error and
exits (it will **not** silently start on the default instance). Absolute paths
work on both platforms (`C:\...`, `/srv/...`); a relative path is resolved against
the DS binaries' folder, not the launcher.

> **Note.** The dedicated server only applies `-path` inside its
> `-console`/`-noconsole` startup branch, which Magnetar's headless launch
> normally skips. Magnetar handles this for you: when `-path` is present and you
> have not passed `-console`/`-noconsole` yourself, it appends `-console`
> automatically so the path takes effect. You do **not** need to pass a console
> flag.

#### `-console` / `-noconsole` (optional)

You do **not** need these to run headless — Magnetar already bypasses the
server's WinForms/Telerik configurator and starts it directly (with console
output enabled, equivalent to `-console`). They differ only in whether the
server, *when running interactively*, attaches to the parent console or
allocates a new console window; on a non-interactive host both are no-ops. Pass
one explicitly only if you want to override that default — e.g. **`-noconsole`**
to skip the console attach entirely when running under Quasar with `-daemon`
(which releases the console on Windows), so the server won't re-grab or pop a
console window. (When you pass `-noconsole` together with `-path`, the server
still applies the path — Magnetar only auto-appends `-console` when *no* console
flag is present.)

Related pass-through DS flags `-session:<path>` (selects which saved world to
load) and `-ignorelastsession` take effect with or without a console flag.

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Effect                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAGNETAR_SAFE_MODE` | When `1`, disables preloader patches for a one-off recovery run. |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`    | Overrides the Magnetar config-dir base (Linux).                  |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`      | Overrides the Magnetar install-dir base (Linux).                 |
| `DS64`               | Build-time override for the DS reference path.                   |

Build-time overrides are covered in full in **[Build.md](Build.md)**.
