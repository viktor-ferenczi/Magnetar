# Magnetar

A plugin and mod loader for the **Space Engineers (SE1) Dedicated Server**. Hard
fork of [Pulsar](https://github.com/SpaceGT/Pulsar), adapted to run the headless
dedicated server — no WinForms, no Telerik UI, no Windows-service host.

Magnetar ships two launchers that drop in for `SpaceEngineersDedicated.exe`:

| Launcher | Runtime | Platforms |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| `MagnetarLegacy` | .NET Framework 4.8 | Windows only |
| `MagnetarInterim` | .NET 10 (via [se-dotnet-compat](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dotnet-compat)) | Windows + Linux |

On **Windows** both launchers are built; on **Linux** only `MagnetarInterim`
(.NET 10).

Compatibility plugins are loaded implicitly:
- [se-dotnet-compat](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dotnet-compat) for .NET 10 compatibility
- [se-linux-compat](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-linux-compat) for Linux compatibility

You can register new plugins by making PRs to the [MagnetarHub](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/magnetarhub).

## Control plane — Quasar

[**Quasar**](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/Quasar/releases) is a separate
control plane with a Web UI that can manage and control **multiple Magnetar
instances** from one place. Each Magnetar runs a server and reports structured
status and logs; Quasar orchestrates them. Launch Magnetar under Quasar with
`-daemon` so restarting Quasar never takes the servers down — see
[Usage](Docs/Usage.md#daemon-mode).
